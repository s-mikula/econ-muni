# Running STATA (BETA VERSION)

This document provides instructions for  running STATA on your computer using a network license provided by ECON MUNI. Network license allows multiple users to share a limited number of licenses over a network. The pool of licenses is funded from project resources and project team members have priority access. **Only one session per user is allowed.**

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Internet connection via EduVPN...** (for instructions see https://it.muni.cz/en/services/eduvpn)
2. **...with "Employee - Econ - HEPII Server" profile.** To get the profile added to your EduVPN account, please contact Štěpán (stepan.mikula@econ.muni.cz).
3. Valid **username (UČO) and password** for the network license. If you do not know your credentials, please contact Štěpán or Michal (michal.kvasnicka@econ.muni.cz)

## Start & use STATA

1. Connect to EduVPN with "Employee - Econ - HEPII Server" profile (see above).
2. Launch STATA client: [Windows](https://fem.econ.muni.cz/STATA.7z) Clients for other platforms are comming.
3. Log in with your UČO and password (see above).
4. Stata starts.
5. Keep EduVPN connection active while using STATA.

Please keep in mind that **only one session per user is allowed.** If you try to start a second session, you will receive an error message. 

The total **number of concurent users is limited,** so if you cannot connect, please try again later. There is a **walltime for each STATA session** (currently 48 hours), after which the session will be automatically terminated. The walltime could be user-specific. If you need a longer session, please contact Štěpán or Michal. (You will receive warning 15 and 5 minutes before the session is terminated.)

## Keep it running for future generations

STATA licenses are not for free. If we want to keep using them, we need to use them responsibly. Keep in mind: 

- to close STATA when you are not using it.
- **include new STATA licences to your project budgets.**
